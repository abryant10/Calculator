# Calculator
a web calculator

You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.

Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!

Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”
Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… don’t let it crash your calculator!

EXTRA CREDIT: Make it look nice! This can be a good portfolio project… but not if it’s UGLY. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.

EXTRA CREDIT: Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.

EXTRA CREDIT: Add keyboard support!
